```{r setup}
#| include: false
# the line below is correcting the path - as it is confusing for targets to find the quarto document inside doc folder ; it is saying go back one level and look in the _targets folder
targets::tar_config_set(store = here::here("_targets")) # here is used for relative paths
library(tidyverse)
library(targets)
source(here::here("R/functions.R"))
# lipidomics <- read_csv(here::here("data/lipidomics.csv"))
lipidomics <- tar_read(lipidomics)
```

## Results

```{r}
tar_read(df_stats_by_metabolite)
```

```{r}
tar_read(fig_metabolite_distribution)
```
