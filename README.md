# AdvancedR3: DDEA Course - December 2024

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project showcases the learning outcomes of the Advanced
Reproducible Research in R. This course was taken in December 2024.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: this folder contains the data used in the present project.
-   `doc/`: this folder contains relevant documents for the project.
-   `R/`: this folder contains RScripts and relevant code for the
    project.

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
